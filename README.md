# Andela-Project

This is a web based built in Python, Flask, React, POSTGRESQL.

I've taken the liberty to add Bootstrap framework to help in responsiveness and enable mobile-first.


# LOGIN FORM

HTML file: login.html
CSS file: login.css

I've used boostrap heavily on this form to facilitate efficient UI for the fields and buttons in this form.
